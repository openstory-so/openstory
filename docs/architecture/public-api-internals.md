# Public API internals: the OpenAPI document and server-side export

How two pieces behind `/api/v1` are built. The user-facing guide is `docs/developer-guide/public-api.md` (published on the site — keep internals out of it).

## Public API OpenAPI document

`GET /api/v1/openapi.json` is built by `src/platform/server/api-v1/openapi.ts`, and **every
schema in it is generated** — nothing is hand-authored. Request bodies come
from the validators the routes parse with; response documents come from the
Zod schemas their TypeScript types are `z.infer`'d from (`state.ts`,
`create.ts`, `list.ts`, `styles.ts`, `hal.ts`). So a response shape cannot
drift from its published contract: change the schema and both move together.

- A component is named by `.meta({ id })`; `componentDefs()` hoists the `$defs`
  Zod emits into `components.schemas` and repoints the refs.
- **`.extend()` mints a new schema and drops the `.meta({ id })`.** Tag the
  shape you actually return — the `_links`-bearing _resource_
  (`sequenceStateResourceSchema`, `styleResourceSchema`), not the bare body —
  or the component is published but never referenced.
- `openapi.test.ts` fails on any dangling `$ref`, which is what caught that.
- Use `z.string().meta({ format: 'date-time' })`, not `z.iso.datetime()`: the
  latter also publishes a multi-hundred-character regex.

## Server-side export (API)

Theatre Download/Copy and the public API both `POST /api/v1/sequences/$id/exports`. There is no in-browser encode. Playback is the live canvas stitch, or a matching ready MP4 (`sourceShotsHash`). Overlay icons on the player; desktop also has an Export dropdown next to Copy script.

- POST 200 = ready row for the current cut (hash computed server-side). POST 202 = reuse a live `processing` row, or reserve one and trigger `SequenceExportWorkflow`. GET `?wait=60s` long-polls. (`src/routes/api/v1/sequences.$id.exports.ts`)
- The workflow absolutizes scene/music URLs, POSTs to the video-export Cloudflare Container (`containers/video-export/`), streams the MP4 into R2, and flips the row to `ready`/`failed`. The container never touches D1.
- Uniform AVC transmuxes; mixed-res/codec is decode→letterbox→re-encode. Production and PR previews run `standard-4`.
- **Local:** `bun dev:all` runs `dev:bunny` and sets `VIDEO_EXPORT_DEV_URL`. Plain `bun dev` and e2e have no renderer — theatre toasts rather than encoding in the tab. Container details: `containers/video-export/README.md`.
